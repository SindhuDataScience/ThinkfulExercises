SQL basics Drill:
----------------

select trip_id, duration from trips where duration > 500 Order by duration;
select * from stations where station_id = 84;
select mintemperaturef from weather where zip = 94301;

Aggregations:
-------------
--What was the hottest day in our data set? Where was that?
select maxtemperaturef, zip, date from weather order by maxtemperaturef desc LIMIT 1
--How many trips started at each station?
select start_station, count(start_station) as no_of_trips from trips group by start_station
--What's the shortest trip that happened?
select min(duration) As shortest_trip from trips
--What is the average trip duration, by end station?
select end_station, avg(duration) As avg_duration from trips group by end_station
