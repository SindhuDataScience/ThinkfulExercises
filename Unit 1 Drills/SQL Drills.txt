SQL basics Drill:
----------------

select trip_id, duration from trips where duration > 500 Order by duration;
select * from stations where station_id = 84;
select mintemperaturef from weather where zip = 94301;

Aggregations:
-------------
--What was the hottest day in our data set? Where was that?
select maxtemperaturef, zip, date from weather order by maxtemperaturef desc LIMIT 1
--How many trips started at each station?
select start_station, count(start_station) as no_of_trips from trips group by start_station
--What's the shortest trip that happened?
select min(duration) As shortest_trip from trips
--What is the average trip duration, by end station?
select end_station, avg(duration) As avg_duration from trips group by end_station

JOINS:
------
--What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
WITH rainy_days AS (select DATE(date) As rainy_day from weather where precipitationin > 0 group by date)
SELECt t.* from trips t
JOIN rainy_days r ON r.rainy_day = DATE(t.start_date)
order by t.duration desc
LIMIT 3

--Which station is full most often?
select st.station_id, count(*) As full_count from stations st
JOIN status s ON s.station_id = st.station_id
where s.docks_available = 0
GROUP By st.station_id
order by full_count desc

--Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
select start_station, dockcount, count(trip_id) as num_of_trips 
from trips t JOIN stations s ON s.name = t.start_station  
group by start_station, dockcount
order by s.dockcount

--(Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
WITH rainy_days AS (select DATE(date) As rainy_day from weather where precipitationin > 0 group by 1)
SELECt DATE(t.start_date), max(duration) As longest_trip from trips t
JOIN rainy_days r ON r.rainy_day = DATE(t.start_date)

AirBnB Challenge:
-----------------
--What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?
select * from sfo_listings order by price desc LIMIT 1
--This listing is of type home/apt and is avilable only for 18 days. Minimum length of stay required is 2 nights

--What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?
select neighbourhood, count(*) As count_of_listings

order by count_of_listings 
desc LIMIT 1
--Mission

--What time of year is the cheapest time to go to San Francisco? What about the busiest?
