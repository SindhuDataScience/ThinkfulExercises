Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, 
split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. 
What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? 
What aspects of KNN would be useful?


Solution:
Take a month's data for each person (with a credit card). Consider the aggregate amount of all the transactions as 100%
Now take the percentage of groceries and utilities together and dining out and entertainment together
That gives us 2 pieces of information (percentage for entertainment and percentage for utilities)
Let us assume that people spending more on entertainment have more capability to pay the bills on time.
Using KNN classification, take those 2 percentages as axes and classify the data as bills on time (1) and not on time (0)
